    <h2><a name="0" class="anchor">Introduction</a></h2>

    <p>I often thought about writing down some of my experiences from the Danish underground during World War II, but
      never really had the incentive to do it until recently when I talked with a friend in Denmark and he mentioned
      that four of his companions from his underground group of 8 had died during the last few years. It then occurred
      to me that soon it will be 50 years since Denmark was liberated by the Allies and this game me the final push to
      get going on the following write up. My paternal grandfather often joked about that he was wounded in the 1864 war
      with Germany. He was 6 years old at the time and was out watching as the soldiers rode by and the sabre of one of
      them hit him in his head. People rarely talk about their experiences during wartime, because it brings back bad
      memories and it is a shame so many interesting legends get lost over time. If we had had more descriptions of the
      horrors of war maybe we would have fewer of them.</p>

    <h2><a name="1" class="anchor">1. The Attack</a></h2>

    <p>There was big commotion in Copenhagen on the morning of April 9th, 1940. Huge swarms of airplanes buzzed
      overhead, green leaflets were dumped on the city in bunches from the air and the chatter of rifle fire could be
      heard from several directions. People ran bewildered out of the houses and met in the streets asking what was
      going on - It was Germany's attack on Denmark, their small peaceful neighbor to the north.</p>


    <p>The leaflets said that the waters around Norway and Denmark had been mined by the British and that Germany was
      occupying the two countries to "protect" them from invasion by England. The leaflets said Germany would leave the
      Danish government and military intact and there would be no fighting so long as the Danes did not offer any
      resistance, but the menacing planes overhead demonstrated that any resistance would be crushed by bombing of
      Copenhagen. Later in the day King Christian X capitulated and ordered the Danish army to lay down its weapons.
      There had been fighting at the King's palace Amalienborg where the Kings guard had put up a brave but short fight
      to stop the attackers but the guard had been overpowered by the superior enemy machine gun fire. Danish soldiers
      had also resisted in the harbor and in the Citadel but were also quickly overpowered. At the border in South
      Jutland fighting had also been short but fierce, the ill prepared Danes had tried to stop the huge German war
      machine but it was a poor match, and after some casualties on both sides they had to give up and let the attackers
      roll on. Control of the Danish news papers and the radio stations were quickly taken over by the Germans and after
      that time these media were a poor source of news because of propaganda and censorship.</p>

    <p>I was 16 years old then and went to "realskole" at Oesterbro. In school, we discussed the grave situation, and we
      were somewhat embarrassed that the Danes had not put up more resistance. But we also could see that ta fight would
      have been hopeless. The Danish government had for years been demilitarizing despite the tense world situation and
      the army was grossly under staffed and with only a handful of weapons. Our history teacher had told us about how
      poorly Denmark was prepared for an attack and had stated jokingly that the Danish deference material consisted of
      only 3 1/2 rolls of barbwire. We later found out that the Danish embassy in Berlin had warned the authorities of
      the approaching attack but still no mobilization order or live ammunition had been issued to the garrisons or the
      soldiers at the border.</p>

    <p>Norway was attacked at the same time, but the Norwegians were better prepared and put up a brave struggle and
      held out for several months before they capitulated. Norway, it should be noted, is easier to defend because it is
      a mountainous country where the people can retreat up in the mountains and fight back much more effectively.</p>

    <p>We lived at Vendersgade, my two older brothers, Adam and Svend and my younger sister Inger and our parents. Adam
      was attending engineering school at Polyteknik Laereanstalt and Svend took apprenticeship in furniture making
      while Inger went to middle school. We had an apartment on the fifth floor just under the roof (close to God and
      the weather as people said). My father had a small furniture shop at Oesterbro where he designed and built
      furniture to order. He made just enough to pay the rent and provide good sound Danish food each day, except, when
      payments were slow coming in the food consisted mostly of potatoes and ground beef. Our mother, though, had a
      tremendous knack for turning the relatively scarce resources into the most delicious meals you could imagine. She
      was especially expert in making the "hakkeboef" with onions and gravy so we all thought she was the world's best
      cook. Discussions around the table always ran loud and emotional with all kinds of subjects and at this time
      mostly the war. Dad had been a corporal under World War One and was all for King, Country, and honor, but he
      always preached moderation. I had heard stories from several sides about the threat of the German regime, first
      from the history teacher, who told about the poor preparations of the military and who was also Svends and Adams
      teacher and then by my buddy. Kai in school whose father was a ships officer on a coal freighter. He and his
      family lived in constant fear for his life because of the threat from the U-boats. Also a few years before on a
      vacation to one of our uncles in the country one of his maids, a Polish Jewish girl had escaped across the Baltic
      sea to Denmark and she had told how she had lost her parents and about how the Jews were at that time, 1938, being
      persecuted by the Nazis.</p>

    <h1><a name="2" class="anchor">2. Escalation of Hostilities</a></h1>

    <p>After the 9th of April the threat of the Germans gradually got worse and worse. In the beginning it was a matter
      of getting used to seeing green uniforms all over and adjust to the lack of credible news. The Danish government
      was left in tact and with the exceptions that we had to deliver all our agricultural products to Germany few
      constraints were imposed on Denmark for the time being. Danish soldiers got back their weapons and were allowed to
      continue their training. But after the occupation of Denmark and Norway, Germany captured first Holland and
      Belgium, then France, then their friends the Italians, who had been duped by the fascist Mussolini joined the
      German cause and they started their conquests in Africa. Eventually Germany broke their anti-aggression pact with
      Stalin and attacked Russia. And again Germany won one big battle after the other. If you listened to the news or
      read the papers they were the invincible heroes and "liberated" one country after the other. They also pretty near
      beat England in some fierce air battles over Britain, but the British survived mainly because of the skill and
      stamina of their fighter pilots and Churchills inspiring speeches. We could pick up scraps of news from England on
      shortwaves, where the programs started with the jubilant "..._" from Beethovens 5th symphony symbolizing a "5" in
      the morse code or "V" for victory, but the transmissions were so badly jammed that it was next to impossible to
      find out what was going on.</p>

    <p>The common attitude in Denmark was to give the Germans a cold shoulder, actually trying to ignore them, waiting
      for the day when we would be free again. Once a German soldier asked me for direction to Noerreport station which
      was at the end of Vendersgade and I told him in English "it's that way". Afterwards I was quite proud of my
      bravery, talking English to a German soldier- but what could he do.</p>

    <aside>Editor's aside: I'm reminded of "Hygge"- a word in Danish meaning comfort, joy, and warmth, is an important
      cultural aspect that, in this context, is denied to the occupiers. For a Dane to give the "cold shoulder" the
      occupying enemy, it was a deeply rooted aspect of defiance outside the physical realm. The Nazis could take over
      their land, but not access their integrity- The Danes would make the occupation as uncomfortable as possible for
      them to live in this state.</aside>

    <p>I finished high school and enrolled to take my engineering apprenticeship ahead of going to engineering school.
      The factory in Aarhusgade where I worked, Helweg Mikkelsen, had very little to do with the Germans but the factory
      on the floor above us was making military material for the Germans. So one morning when I got to work everybody
      was standing outside on the street and the whole big building was black with soot and smoke. The factory above us
      had been blown up during the night by Danish saboteurs. Everybody working on the night shift had been ushered
      outside and the saboteurs, Danish freedom fighters, went up and placed explosives in strategic locations, and
      afterwards blew up the place. It was amazing how completely the explosion had destroyed the whole floor above us
      and nothing else in the building, so our factory was able to continue working a few days later.</p>

    <p>These explosions became more and more frequent as the war dragged on and eventualluy it came to a point when at
      least once a week you would hear a big explosion, indicating that another factory had been blown up.</p>

    <p>Occassionally my company would get a little job from the Germans, that was unavoidable, and one time my master
      mechanic, Bonsoe, whispered, "look, this is for the Germans", so he took a spike and drove it into a cable, that
      was shielded with a braided metal shield outside. Afterwards you couldn't tell from the outside that it had been
      tampered with, but the inside was sure to have bee pretty well messed up.</p>

    <p>A couple of years after the attack on Denmark, Adam was drafted into the Danish army, which had no function in
      the war. Adam went to an anti-air artillery division on Fyn where they were practicing with anit-air artillery and
      listening devices for locating aircraft.</p>

    <p>AAs the saboteur attacks on facilities that supported Germany increased and railroad troop transports were
      sabotaged, the relationship between the occupiers and the population became more and more tense and the Germans
      countered with arrests of saboteurs and reprisals by Gestapo. - Svend one day asked if I wanted to get into the
      resistance movement. I knew this was a dangerous undertaking with many unknowns, but with Denmark in the process
      of losing its independence and Germany terrorizing all of Europe there seemed to be only one answer to that
      question and that was to join. I was put in contact with a Mr. Anderson who was a vice landlord in an apartment
      house next to where we used to live at Ribegade, and who was helping to form a new group under a Mr. Sandberg.
      Svend had already joined the resistance movement and was in a different group. The groups that were formed at that
      time were organized by former Danish military personnel and were called waiting groups, because their purpose was
      mainly to wait for or to create an opportunity to liberate the country. The groups had 8 members each and received
      instruction on weapon use and guerilla warfare. Sandberg had one bad leg but he was extremely agile and could move
      about more swiftly than anybody. To avoid discovery there was great secrecy in the organization and nobody knew
      where the other members lived except for the group leaders. We met once a week at night every time at a new
      location which had been announced at the previous meeting. The streets were now dark at night after all lights had
      to be blinded at dusk and it was difficult to orient oneself with onlh a thin slit in the bicycle light. At the
      meetings there werwe instructors on different subjects of clandestine warfare and we learned about different
      weapons and practiced using them without actually firing them. We had to take the weapons apart and reassemble
      them and we learned how to load and fire the gun and how to use it against an enemy in guerilla warfare. One time
      we had an instructor who had fought in the Finnish war against Russia. It was not a pleasant subject as he
      described battle tactics, but war is grim and we certainly got a good taste for it in listening to him.</p>

    <p>The sabotage against the factories and troop transports were carried out with the great efficiency in Denmark and
      were a big hindrance to the German war effort so they became very brutal in their reprisals and would shoot
      innocent people, particularly students, in an attempt to scare the saboteurs. Many resistance fighters got caught
      because of informers, "stikkere" as we called them, so secrecy became an obsession. The secrecy was so strict you
      just did not tell anybody about the underground work. Not even one's girlfriend or classmates or even one's best
      friend. If a member of the resistance was caught he would be tortured to compel him to tell about his companions.
      We had a system in our group where we had to call a phone number each day and through coded messages we would
      learn if any member of the group had been picked up. The number our group called belonged to a tobacco store and
      we would ask for a certain brand of cigarettes. If the answer was, "no we don't have that make" (which was usually
      true), then everything was ok, but if they replied that they had a certain other brand then there was trouble and
      we had to leave the place where we lived, "going under ground" as it was called, and we would not meet at the next
      agreed upon meeting place. We had a system whereby we could contact the group leader in that case and get back
      together. The waiting groups Svend and I were in were not involved in active sabotage but were, as previously
      indicated, only supposed to be in readiness in case an armed force was needed.</p>

    <aside>Editor's aside: while researching the word "stikkere", meaning "informant", I began typing into Google
      translate and received "Norwegian detected" for "stikke" - "to sting". In Danish, it also revealed "to poke,
      engrave, or sting", which I feel further pushes the understanding of the effect- what worse feeling than that of
      someone you trust not only deceiving you, but putting your very enemy at thy advantage with you as the sacrifice.
      I would imagine this was not often the will of the informant outside of threats, and maybe the sting had been felt
      at that point as well. Further examination should give more perspective.</aside>

    <h2><a name="3" class="anchor">3. State of War Between Denmark and Germany</a></h2>

    <p>As the war progressed the German demands for Danish food products and war material escalated and food rationing
      was tightened, resulting in increased resistance and sabotage. During the summer of 1943 the workers struck in
      many factories as a protest against the occupiers, and the situation worsened, eventually culminating in a general
      strike in August with the whole industry shutting down. This in turn prompted the Germans to issue an ultimatum on
      August 29 prohibiting strikes, punishable with death. Many other restrictions were also imposed on the population
      including prohibition against assembly, a curfew, closing of stores after dark, etc. A military emergency was
      proclaimed by the Germans and they attacked the Danish military garrisons, which were still intact, and after a
      short fight put all the Danish personnel in prison. This date has since been officially recognized by the Allies
      as the date at which Denmark was officially at war with Germany.</p>

    <p>Adam's division on Fyn was attacked with machine gun fire early in the morning. In an e-mail message he sent to
      me on the 52nd anniversary of the attack last year after I had reminded him of the infamous day he wrote the
      following: "... you are right - today is August 29 - yea - that was quite some night.- We woke up or were awakened
      at 3 o'clock in the morning when they were shooting through our tents - they had three machine guns set up around
      the perimeter of our camp and threw hand grenades into the camp. We had to pull back into a brick building which
      we used for mess - and they were shooting through the building. One bullet hit a water pipe main and water was
      gushing all over. At 8 o'clock the phone rang and our captain was ordered for us to surrender. We had some wounded
      but not dead. The Germans had two dead and one wounded who later died. He was their chief. The German doctor came
      in and bandaged everyone wounded. One soldier in the tent next to me got his rear end full of splinters from a
      German hand grenade. He wasn't badly wounded but lost a good deal of blood. - That was a rude awakening.</p>

    <p>A few weeks later rumors circulated that the Germans were about to capture the Danish Jews and a huge rescue
      operation ensued. The Danish clergy and the head Jewish rabbi organized a messenger network and with the help of
      student organizations, hospital workers and the underground was able to contact almost every single Jewish person
      in the country. The hospitals and churches immediately put up the hiding places for all the Jews and many were
      hiding out in private homes and in fishing villages. Fisheren organized a sort of armada of boats and in the
      following weeks secretly and at great risk ferried the frightened refugees to Sweden. I later learned that it was
      Niels Bohr*, the famous Danish nuclear physicist, who persuaded the Swedish government to accommodate the Jewish
      refugees. He had made the acceptance of the Jews by the Swedes a condition for his working on the atomic bomb. The
      following is quoted from Rescue in Denmark, by Harold Flender: "Just before leaving Denmark, Bohr had been told by
      his friend Hans Hedtoft (Leader of Danish Social Democrat Party) about the plans for rounding up the Danish Jews.
      Meeting the Swedish foreign minister, Bohr announced that he had no intention of leaving Sweden until the foreign
      minister promised refuge to all Danish Jews who were able to reach Swedish shores. Angered about the Swedish
      foreign minister's uncooperative response, Bohr demanded an audience with the Swedish king. King Gustav assured
      Bohr that he was sympathetic to the problem and would give it his careful consideration. The next day Bohr
      received word from King Gustav that Sweden would accept the Danish Jews". Bohr was then smuggled first to England
      and then USA for work on the Manhattan Project.</p>

        keep loaning this out and not getting it back, so this copy stays with me. I am absolutely amazed that most
        people have no idea of what went on in Denmark during the war. They are astounded when they discover that
        history. Such a small country and such big successes! As a Dane in Canada whose father was one of the Danish
        Underground publishers, I am proud to be from such brave stock. The book tells a gallant story in wonderful
        prose. Kudos. Linkedin person: https://www.linkedin.com/in/kirsten-hauge-browning-60529526/?originalSubdomain=ca

        <p>About a month later the Germans let the Danish soldiers free and Adam was home again. A few days after Adam
          got home he and I visited Svend's furniture shop which he had by now established in Koldinggade at Oesterbro.
          Svend had rented a floor in a small building behind an apartment house and had single handedly built up a
          mechanized shop fully equipped to build furniture. On the way back to Vendersgade we were about to cross
          Blejdamsvejen at the Free Mason lodge which the Germans had occupied. But just past the building a barrage of
          shooting broke out from the lodge and we quickly ran to the side of the street where there was cover behind a
          small hill. We were lying there for a while and could hear the bullets whistle over our heads without knowing
          what was actually happening. But then the shooting stopped and we carefully got up and continued on the way
          home. On the way I asked Adam: "How about joining the resistance movement." "Too late," he said- "I'm already
          in it".</p>

        <p>He had joined an active Polytekniker group which published an "Illegal" newspaper and which made hand
          grenades and did research on flamethrowers. The Polytekniker groups participated in sabotage and had several
          fights with the Germans during the war. Adam also helped picking up weapons that were dropped in Nordsjaelland
          from Allied airplanes.</p>

        <aside>https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytekniker_Bataljonen: Polytechnic The battalion was a Danish resistance
          group during the occupation. The group consisted of engineering students at the Polytechnic who, as part of a
          special form of military service, almost all had a military education.

          Polytechnic The battalion emerged from the turn of the year 1943 - 1944 as a military resistance group. The
          battalion did not come together in battle, but served as companies of each approx. 100 men, a total of approx.
          450 men at the turn of the year 1943-44. The group's earliest tasks in the autumn of 1943 were to move depots
          with military equipment. Thereby, military equipment was built up to approx. 500 mand. From the group, 19
          polytechnics were killed during the freedom struggle.

          On the day of liberation on 5 May 1945, units from the Polytechnic Battalion were in charge of guarding the
          Polytechnic in case the German capitulation did not proceed according to plan. Other units with about 100
          polytechnic students were sent to Kastrup on the same day to take over the guarding of the airport. At the
          airport, the group received the English planes that arrived in Denmark.</aside>


        <p>While Svend was busy making furniture to order at his little shop, Adam and I had started a business on the
          side repairing radios at night. It turned into a sort of whole sale repair shop where a couple of radio stores
          would drop off bad radios during the day and we would repair them at night. We had built a small laboratory in
          an attic room next to the apartment. Svend had built a neat workbench for us with a large instrument panel at
          the back and I had equipped the panel with discarded voltmeters, ammeters and other instruments from the place
          where I worked and we had also set up a motor generator for alternating current (ac) because we had only dc at
          the apartment. At times the front flight of stairs were piled up to the ceiling with radios to be fixed and we
          would sit up till late at night and repair them. In this way we were able to supplement our income to help
          studying pay for the food.</p>

        <p>Doing the radio work we often heard complaints from people that they were unable to pick up the British news
          casts. Although we could hear the news on the Swedish radio their version was quite watered down because the
          Swedes even though they were neutral had a brisk business with the Germans, and they were afraid of upsetting
          their good customer with damaging reports from the war front. We had been experimenting with different radio
          techniques for many years as a hobby and were familiar with directional antennas and Adam then designed a loop
          antenna using discarded copper wire from old transformers. Svend made up a frame of wood for the wire thus
          forming a loop and he made a turned wooden base that could hold a variable capacitor for tuning. The model
          worked really well, especially after Adam invented a refined system that used an extra loop within the loop
          for fine tuning. With a little dexterity and patience we could now receive BBC almost as clearly as a local
          radio station. It was not long before we had many orders and we all got busy winding thin copper wire on
          frames, painting bases and tuning radio antennas. We were so busy that we even had to enlist the help of Inger
          who at this time had started school at Kunst Academiet. There was a problem, however, the Germans had
          prohibited the use of loop antennas and the prohibition was strictly enforced. In Norway the Germans had
          confiscated all radios and people were put in jail if they were found using a radio, but in Denmark you could
          still have a radio as long as you did not listen to English broadcasts. We therefore had to smuggle these
          antennas to their destinations in great secrecy covering them in brown paper bags and newspapers. Still you
          always ran the risk of being frisked if you carried something suspicious looking. The frisking was done by
          Gestapo soldiers who were not patrolling the streets carrying automatic pistols. They would walk in pairs, one
          on each sidewalk with the gun at the ready and with one soldier shifted behind the other for coverage. It was
          a spooky situation which could make you quite nervous when you met a pair like that.</p>

        <p>Despite the German threats another general strike took place in early 1944 as a protest against the
          escalating cruelty of the occupiers. There were big demonstrations in Copenhagen and a number of stores that
          cooperated with the Germans were set on fire. People threw burning mattresses in the streets and the whole
          city turned into one big riot. Svend and I walked down through the Stroejet where people were singing the
          community "Internationale". We joined in of course, even though we were not communists. Shooting could be
          heard from all directions and we walked further on down to Istedgade and came past a shoe store owned by our
          landlords son, Mr. Jorgensen and his German born wife. The store was a terrible mess, the windows had been
          smashed and people were looting the store. Some people were shouting "Nazis". The Jorgensen's were the nicest
          and most friendly people you could imagine and we really felt sorry for them, but there was nothing we could
          do.</p>

        <p>Later during the day we went back to Vendersgade and we could see huge smoke clouds coming from across the
          lake (Sortedamsoen, Peblingesoen, etc.). It was the big department store Bulldog that was on fire. The Bulldog
          stores were known to collaborate offering preferential treatment to the Germans. There were cases when Germans
          were seen buying sparse merchandise and the same items were refused a Danish customer. Such stores would now
          feel the brunt of the angry Danes.</p>

        <p>The next day the Germans tried to restore order and they now freely used their weapons when they saw people
          gathered in groups. (Part of the ultimatum was that no more than 5 people could be gathered in one place). And
          they shot at anything they felt like. I was acquainted with a young girl at the time and went over and visited
          her in Nansengade. Her father had been hauled off to Shell Huset, the Gestapo headquarter for interrogation
          once, because he had a Jewish sounding last name, but was let go again. While I was there some commotion
          developed in the street below and I went over to look out the window but I quickly pulled my head back because
          some shots went up at the windown, fortunately only shattering some plaster.</p>

        <h2><a name="4" class="anchor">4. Underground Episodes</a></h2>

        <p>When I finished my apprenticeship in 1944 I started an academic course to gain the entrance requirement for
          Polyteknik Laereanstalt to study for an engineering degree. The school was located near the German Police
          headquarters, where the German police, which we called Hipos, raced back and forth through the street in their
          black cars with blaring sirens. They had removed the doors from the cars and sat pointing their submachine
          guns through the door openings when they were out looking for freedom fighters and saboteurs. Adam and I had
          discussed the possibility of an ambush to blow up one of their vehicles. I checked with my group leader but he
          warned against any such action because it had to be coordinated by the underground leadership and any
          casualties of Germans could lead to severe reprisals against innocent citizens, so we dropped thinking about
          that. One day during class there were loud noises of boots and scrambling of weapons in the front yard of the
          school. It was the Hipo that was on a hunt for a freedom fighter in our class. A couple of them ran upstairs
          to our classroom which was on the second floor, and one of them started firing from the open doorway into the
          classroom hitting the ceiling with an automatic pistol. We all fell flat down on the floor but one of the
          students jumped up and ran out past the Hip in the doorway so swiftly that he was completely taken by surprise
          and before he could turn around and shoot, the student jumped down one flight of stairs to the landing between
          floors and jumped out an open window and escaped. After that incident the classes moved to a new location,
          where we continued our studies.- Every day I called the tobacco store asking for the brand of cigarettes that
          ensured our resistance group was safe, but then one day they gave the signal to go "under ground". I got hold
          of Adam and Svend and told them to stay away from Vendersgade. Adam and I then rented a room in
          Tordenskjoldsgade which is located downtown near the Royal Theater. Svend by this time spent most of his
          non-working hours with his girlfriend. I contacted my group leader at the prearranged phone number and the
          next weekly meeting of the group was rescheduled to a different location. It turned out that our weapons depot
          and the instructor who had been teaching weapons use had disappeared, but exact circumstances were not known.
          We stayed away from Vendersgade for some time, but since everything was quiet there with no searches by the
          Germans we eventually drifted home now and then and eventually shows up again quite regularly.</p>

        <p>We had to take care of the radio repair business and besides that Adam brought home cases of weapons and
          ammunition he had helped picking up from parachute drops in Nordsjaelland as part of his Polytekniker
          underground work. These drops were made by British pilots, and the time and location were announced in coded
          language over BBC. The Polytekniker groups had access to a van that had been reinforced with steel plates and
          they drove out at night and picked up the weapons. Some of the shipments were taken to Vendersgade, where we
          all got busy because the weapons were covered with grease that had to be cleaned off. Also, the magazines had
          to be loaded with bullets so we would all, Inger, Adam and I and Svend when he was home, worked at that night
          in our attic room where we had our radio shop.</p>

        <p>We usually played the record player pretty loud when we were working and one night Mr. Jorgensen, the vice
          landlord, who was married to a German woman, and who live on the third floor came upstairs to the attic room
          where we were sitting working. He opened the door and stood there with his eyes almost dropping out and looked
          at all the weapons and ammunition. He was as startled as we were, he at seeing the weapons and we at seeing
          Mr. Jorgensen. But he kept his composure, and after a short while he just said "Would you please turn the
          radio down" and then he left without saying anything else. We never hear a word about that afterwards. He was
          a brave soul and so was his wife, the whole building would have been blown up if we had been discovered and we
          surely would have been shot.</p>

        <p>Sometime during the winter 1943/44 my bicycle was stolen in Vendersgade and it was important that I had a
          means of transportation in case of messenger duty or some other tasks I might be assigned. In the meantime we
          had observed a German soldier visiting a woman, or "field mattress" as we called them, on the top floor where
          we had our room at Tordenskjoldsgade. He always came on his green military bicycle which had heavy tires and
          strange looking handlebars. One afternoon as Adam and I were walking home, we saw this German soldier, as
          usual parking his bicycle at the curb and going into a bakery store on the way to see his girlfriend, so we
          switftly grabbed the vehicle, turned around a corner or two and hurried to our apartment house. We went to the
          back stairs and carefully carried the bicycle up to our room. It was a very precarious situation because of
          the steep stairs and we had to be careful not to make any noise so the neighbors would become suspicious (what
          are these two young guys doing carrying a German bicycle up the backstairs?). We made it through undiscovered
          and go the bicycle into the room, where we sank down on the couches and almost died from laughing. It was such
          a relief to have it over with. The sudden change from total concentration and fear of discovery must have
          played a trick on our nerves. - The bicycle was repainted and outfitted with new handlebars and was
          unrecognizable after the transformation and provided me with excellent transportation thereafter. We wondered
          what kind of punishment the soldier was to endure and how much the war was shortened because the Wehrmacht was
          deprived of one of their vehicles. Maybe a few seconds.</p>

        <p>We also once had to move the contents of an "illegal" print shop from a place at Noerrebrogade to another
          location because there was an indication the Germans had discovered the print shop. Everything including a
          whole load of "illegal" news bulletins and a printing press and books and other different printing
          paraphernalia was loaded on a 3-wheeled delivery bicycle and I pedaled it off. It was quite nerve wrecking
          because nobody could tell when the Germans would show up to confiscate the material. We got the job done
          though without incidence.</p>

        <p>Another time some people in Adams Polytekniker group had to test out a secret transmitter they had made for
          communications with the British. The test took place at night in a villa in a residential area at Hellerup and
          Adam and I were assigned to guard opposite corners of the place. We each hot a Husquarna automatic pistol from
          a cache of weapons we had in the attic in Vendersgade and took off separately to the place in Hellerup. I had
          the pistol under my wind breaker concealing it as best as I could, although on close scrutiny you could see
          some sharp corners sticking out, and went down the stairs at Vendersgade, opened the front door, and stepped
          out on the sidewalk and there only about 20 feet away a German patrol soldier walked straight toward me from
          the direction of Groentorvet with his gun at the ready. Behind him on the opposite sidewalk another soldier
          was covering him also with his gun at the ready. My heart felt as if it was going to jump out of my chest and
          the adrenalin must have been flowing at record speed. I resolved right there in what must have been a few
          milliseconds that the only thing to do was fire first in case they should attempt to frisk me. But I was
          tremendously relieved when they just gave me a stare and walked right on. So I got on the subway at Noerreport
          Station and proceeded out to the assigned villa and took up my position at the corner of the villa. I stood
          there in the darkness for a while with Adam at the opposite corner unseen to me. The whole operation was
          fairly short lived because a transmitter like that can only be operated for about 10 minutes before it must be
          shot down to avoid being picked up by the enemy directional antennas. I did not notice anything unusual during
          the watch, but when I met Adam afterwards he told me that he had seen a German patrol car with a directional
          antenna cruising down the street past where he stood. </p>

        </aside>

        <p>I volunteered once to build a 30 MHz shortwave receive to pick up transmissions from England. That was also
          for the Polytekniker group. (Adam would get me small assignments like that now and then). In those days 30 MHz
          was pushing the state of the art for an ordinary shortwave receiver, but I was able to locate some radio tubes
          tha would handle that frequency and with Adams help in designing it built a super regenerative receiver that
          worked quite well. I remember delivering it to an office in Pilestraede and a young man accepted it thanking
          me very much for my trouble. When I told him I had spent 30 crowns for parts for the receiver. He apologized
          and said he didn't have any money, but instead asked if I would take one of their tables in the office for
          payment, which I accepted because I thought we could always use another table. While I was building the
          receiver some freedom fighters came up to Vendersgade and photographed me while I was working on it. They said
          the pictures would be made public when the war was over, but I have never seen any of them. In retrospect I
          think it was a little risky because with that publicity because anything could have happened if those pictures
          had gotten into the wrong hands.</p>

        <p>There was also some activity aimed at raising money for the underground and as part of that some "illegal"
          books were sold at a profit. I got a couple of those books and peddled one of them to the father of the girl I
          knew. A few days after I had sold him the book Gestapo ransacked his apartment but found nothing they could
          use against him. Fortunately he hid the book under a rug when he was not reading it. His wife, who had always
          been very friendly toward me, changed attitude and appeared to be angry at me for having caused her husband to
          get into such a critical situation.</p>

        <p>One of the most exciting and scary events during the war and something that still sends a chill down my spine
          when I think of it was an incident that occurred when Adam and I decided to take a pistol away from a German
          soldier. Despite the drops of weapons by the British and shipments of Husquarna automatic pistols from Sweden
          there was a big shortage of weapons for the resistance movement and often freedom fighters stole weapons from
          German soldiers when they rode in street cars or frequented crowded streets where a getaway was relatively
          easy. We had found an area behind the Tivoli gardens where many German soldiers walked to and from the Police
          Headquarters which they had taken over. The plan was to coast up close behind a soldier on bicycle, park the
          bicycle at the curb and then sneak up behind the soldier and trip him on the sidewalk, taking his gun while he
          was lying down. We rode around for a while and spotted a good candidate walking away from the police station
          and we started the attack as planned. The first part of the operation went according to plan. Adam walked up
          in front of him and pushed him while I tripped him as he tried to keep his balance. Adam, who was quite good
          at German having taken his 9 months apprenticeship in Berlin in the beginning of the war, pointed his pistol
          at the soldier telling him to lie still and said we only wanted his pistol. I wrestled his pistol out of the
          holster while Adam told him not to move. As we backed off from him with our pistols drawn and moved toward the
          bicycles which were about 25 feet away we saw a pair of German soldiers coming around a corner across the
          street heading toward us. They apparently had not noticed anything unusual but the soldier we had taken the
          pistol from started yelling help, "zu hilfe, zu hilfe". At that time we were only a few feet from the bicycles
          and we jumped on to them but in the confusion I dropped the newly acquired pistol at the curb. There was no
          time to pick it up, we only thought of getting away as fast as possible and we rode as fast as the bicycles
          would carry us toward Raadhuspadsen. I still clearly remember wondering then about when a hail of bullets
          would start flying, but for some reason no shooting occurred. That was a close call and we both kept shaking a
          long time after we were safely home in Tordenskjoldsgade. Tordenskjold was a famous Danish patriot from a long
          forgotten war, but maybe he was still looking out for us.</p>

        <aside>

          Peter Tordenskjold: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Tordenskjold


        </aside>

        <p>Another day when we were sitting studying in our room in Tordenskjoldsgade we heard airplanes flying closely
          over the rooftops and shortly after the anti-aircraft artillery started thundering away. The British had
          started a precision bombing attack on Shell Huset, Gestapos headquarter. It was a sight I can't forget, the
          Spitfires zooming overhead showing their nationality by the well known red-white-blue circles under their
          wings. The British had obtained a detailed plan of the building and knew where the Gestapo had their offices
          and where the prisoners, Danish freedom fighters, were located. The pilots had been practicing on similar
          targets in England and they were able to launch the bombs through specific windows to completely destroy the
          floors where the Gestapo were working and with very little damage to the floors where the prisoners were. Many
          of the freedom fighters held prisoners saved their lives by climbing down the gutter down spouts on the
          outside of the building and escaped in the confusion. There was a bad incidence in connection with the attack;
          one of the British planes which was hit by anti-aircraft artillery fell on a girls school which caught fire
          and many of the children died. Shellhuset burned wildly afterwards, and for the rest of the day explosion
          after explosion could be heard as the fire spread to different areas where the Gestapo had ammunition and
          explosives stored.</p>

        <p>With these different activities going on we still had to attend to our business in Vendersgade and we also
          had to do our studies at the same time. Also Svend and I went to gymnastics classes a couple of times a week
          and the weekly underground training meetings had to be attended as well. Most of the time we all met in
          Vendersgade after school and Svend who was quite involved with his own shop in Koldinggade and with his
          girlfriend Hertha often was there too taking his Hertha along. He also brought the material for the
          directional antennas which he made in his woodworking shop. Hertha was a happy Fynbo with a contagious humor
          and a big laugh. Our cousins Tove, Vibeke, and Ulla also visited on and off as did some of Ingers study mates
          from Kunstacademiet. Although Svend and I, as mentioned earlier were members of different underground groups
          we never discussed our activities, secrecy being an almost ingrown habit by now but I am sure he followed a
          similar regimen since he was in the same division as I. Adam and I often stayed over night at Vendersgade
          saving the trip back to our room in Tordenskjoldsgade.</p>

        <p>There was always the overhanging threat that something had leaked out or spies had got on the track of
          something. Denmark was one of the most liberty loving countries in Europe probably with the smallest number of
          Nazi sympathizers, perhaps with the exception of Norway, but still the elections in 1943 indicated that 2.1
          percent of the population voted for the Nazi party. Out of this percentage obviously some were traitors and
          would be apt to inform on their fellow citizens for money or other reasons. When I stayed at Vendersgade I
          slept in a little room with a skylight in the middle of the apartment, but the fear of the Germans was so
          great that you could not take a chance of being unprepared so I always had a gun at my side in the bed ready
          to defend myself in case the enemy should show up.</p>

        <p>Once when I was home in Vendersgade in a break from the school my mother heard heavy footsteps and what
          sounded like rattling of weapons on the stairs. Alarmed that it might be Gestapo she told me to hide, so I
          slipped up through the skylight onto the flat roof and went behind a chimney and hid there. I had been
          crouching behind the chimney a little while when my mother called up through the skylight and said laughing
          "It was just the mailman".</p>

        <p>There is no doubt that the work of the freedom fighters helped shortening the war, thus saving many lives on
          the battlefields. They worked in the following important areas. They printed and distributed the "illegal"
          newsprint, sabotaged industries that produced military material for the Nazis, sabotaged troop transports
          going through Denmark and in general helped destroying the morale of the enemy so he would eventually give up.
          Regarding the sabotage of troop transports, important derailments took place before the Battle of the Bulge
          that delayed deployment of fresh German troops to the battle front. To maintain the underground work it was
          also necessary for the freedom fighters to build up their arsenal of arms through collection of arms from
          airdrops by the Allies and steal weapons from the Germans. Stealing weapons was important because it not only
          shortened their arsenal but augmented the supply for the Resistance movement.</p>

        <h2><a name="5" class="anchor">5. The Finish</a></h2>

        <p>Finally the great day arrived when the Germans surrendered. Different parts of Europe had different dates for
          the cessation of hostilities. In Denmark the date was May 5, 1945. Our liberation was assigned to the British
          under general Montgomery, and I understand that the Allies had a choice of liberating other areas first but
          decided on Denmark and Norway because of the effective resistance offered by those countries. In Norway the
          Germans held out longer and kept on fighting until May 17, when they finally surrendered there too.</p>

        <p>The members of our group were ordered to assemble on the 4th of May and we met at Andersons apartment off
          Ribegade. All 8 members of the group were gathered in his living room where we were issued the designated red,
          white, and blue armband which identified us as legitimate freedom fighters, and we were each issued a weapon,
          ammunition and a helment. There was a diversity of weapons; I got an old Enfield rifle, a type we had received
          instructions in during our weekly meetings. Although I was familiar with the gun, I was not quite sure how the
          safety mechanism worked. There was a lever with a green and a red area showing depending on the position. He
          said: "The gree,", but I said: "No I think it is the red". Just to make sure I pointed the gun into a corner
          of the room behind me and pulled the trigger. He was right. What a bang. It sounded as if a cannon had gone
          right off in our ears, and everybody was a little shaken and I was very embarrassed. A little while later a
          fellow came into the room holding a revolver in his hand and asked if he could join us. The group leader
          Sandberg said: "Can I see that gun?". He then took it and said to the fellow: "Get out and don't come back".
        </p>

        <aside>Shot the gun in the leader's living room!? Seems it would draw attention... was this in the country? Also
          the mention of the fellow holding the revolver- who was he and why was he not permitted?</aside>

        <p>We were then instructed to meet the next morning at Ribegade, at a public building that had been assigned as
          our headquarter. We should carry our weapons and the red, white and blue armband. Detailed instructions would
          be issued the following day. - Svend was also there, in the same uniform as myself, a red, white, and blue
          armband, he was as mentioned earlier in the same division but in a different group. As far as I can remember
          the division leaders name was commander Kjoeldsen.</p>

        <p>Our first assignment was to take over guard duty from the Germans of a refugee camp at the Randersgade Public
          school. The Germans had turned over their weapons but one still had a revolver which we confiscated and then
          somebody else marched them off without any incidents. We took turns guarding the place and in between were
          assigned other duties. I went with a couple of other freedom fighters to arrest a collaborator in a nearby
          street. We went up to the assigned address, I think it was in Holsteinsgade, and we identified the name on the
          front door. Nobody answered, so one of my companions started firing his gun through the door, which I thought
          was very reckless, so I yelled at him to stop. What if somebody innocent was hiding behind the door? - As we
          drove down Oesterbrogade on the way back, another group had picked up some collaborators, including a girl, in
          a truck. The captives were all standing on the truck bed, the girl screaming, to one of the freedom fighters:
          "How could you do that to your sister?". - Back at the headquarters the collaborators started coming in. A
          Danish policeman recognized a man he had previously encountered under adverse circumstances, maybe as a spy, I
          did not know what crime he was suspected of. The policeman was very upset and punched the suspect in his face
          with his fist. This was of course not the proper punishment but the suspected perpetrator would eventually
          face trial later to account for any misdeeds committed. </p>

        <aside>In the US we are living in a time of unwarranted mindlessness by not only the police but government
          bodies enabling reckless behaviour that continually targets minorities as though they were less than human.
          The thought of yelling at your partner for doing the wrong thing absolutely has a place in our society, but we
          live in fear of speaking out of place- in the "land of the free". </aside>


        <p>During our breaks from duty Svend and I went down to Triangelen, at the corner of Oesterbrogade and Nordre
          Frihavnsgade, where some of the British soldiers hung out, so we chatted with them and we had fun trying to
          ride some of their BSA motorcycles. Svend as usual was an almost instant expert having a knack for mechanical
          things and a good balance.</p>

        <p>A few days after the liberation some German diehards had still not surrendered, and our group was sent out to
          the corner of Nordre Frihavnsgade and Strand Boulevarden, where the 4 Germans had fled to a rooftop, from
          where they fired at some freedom fighters who tried to pin them down. Our group under Sandberg was ordered to
          enter the building and go up on the roof and capture them. In order to get into the building we had to cross
          Nordre Frihavnsgade, but a German cruiser in the harbor which also had not surrendered yet had their 20 mm
          cannon pointed down Nr. Frihavnsgade and sporadically fired down the street so you could see the sparks flying
          as the bullets hit the cobblestone pavement. We waited for a pause in the barrage and then ran across the
          street as fast as we could. Nobody got hit. Once inside the building we found our way up to the attic and were
          searching for an opening to the roof. There was fire going on both from the roof and from the street, and one
          bullet went through the roof tile splintering some woodwork and one splinter hit me in my nose so it bled a
          little bit. That was the only wound I received in action during the war. Anyhow, we could not locate any
          openings and went down to the street again to try another approach. Discussing what strategy to take Andersen
          said: "I am an old guy, I will just walk out in the street and when they start shooting at me you guys get
          them". So that's what he did, and as predicted, the Germans started firing, one bullet hitting the sight of
          his gun and ricocheting off without harming him. The tactic was not successful, though, because we could not
          get a good sighting on the Germans. Our group then went up in a building across the street at Strand
          Boulevarden, from where we would then attempt to hit them. As we got up into an attic I opened an attic
          window, the slanted kind that rests on a metal bar with holes in it for different positions, and standing on
          my tiptoes I proceeded to put my head out through the window to try to spot the Germans. But then I thought:
          "This is foolish, what if they spot me and start shooting?" so I pulled my head back and placed the helmet at
          the end of the rifle and stuck that out through the window to check if it was safe. All was quiet for a while
          so I pulled the gun back in again and just then some bullets crashed through the windows. Good thing! I was
          not about to try putting my head through that window again. Eventually the firing died out, we could not spot
          anybody and we were not able to caputure the die hards so we finally went back to the headquarter. </p>

        <p>We also had to escort the beaten enemy on their way back to Germany. The freedom fighters were assigned to
          protect the mile after mile long column of miserably looking, dirty, and wounded soldiers marching or humping
          through the city with "Koebenhavnerne" lining the route furiously shouting and spitting at them. Without
          protection the soldiers would surely have been attacked by the angry people. That was a sight I will never
          forget, the beaten German army.</p>

        <p>Denmark was liberated just as I was doing final preparations for the entrance exam for Polyteknisk
          Laereanstalt and a few weeks later the class was assembled for the last instructions before the exam. I
          slipped down to class in my "uniform" between guard duties and quite a surprise awaited me there. More than
          1/2 of the class was in the same uniform as I, with the red, white and blue armband. It looked as if just
          about everybody had been in the underground during the war. There was a buddy of mine sitting next to me who I
          had spoken to every day and I had no idea that he was also involved in the resistance movement. - The exams
          took place a few days later, but with the pressure of the times I think very few of us passed. I gave up going
          to the finals after a test in Astronomy, where I had the whole universe turned upside down.</p>

        <p>A few months later I was enrolled in the Danish army and after a period of some pretty rough training finally
          became a bona fide soldier.</p>


        <p>
          After the military experience I went to another engineering school. Teknikum, where my previous education
          qualified to get me in.
        </p>

        <p>A year and a half after the war our brother Svend died in a sailing accident in Sweden. He had gone to Sweden
          to learn about mechanized furniture making and was out in the weekend with a Norwegian friend and two female
          passengers in a sailboat that turned over in a bad wind gust. The girls could not swim and here Sven and his
          male companion showed their true courage by first bringing the two girls to safe ground through the frigid
          October water before they went out again to try to save the boat. In this last attempt though, they did not
          succeed.</p>

        <h2>Editor's Notes</h2>

        <p>I am the grandson of Adam Jorgensen, the brother mentioned in the story. I am incredibly grateful to his
          brother and his brother's family for making this book, as it is not only a look into the life of my Bedstefor
          (grandfather) before I knew him (- let alone before my own mother was born!), but a profound personal
          historical account of some very dark times in recent history that forever shaped many aspects of life and
          society today. I'm proud of what they stood for, I'm proud to be related to the incredibly brave and
          thoughtful people of Denmark, and am eternally grateful for their bravery and relentlessness under Nazi
          occupation.</p>

        <p>My mom, Vibeke Jorgensen, gave me a photocopied of this book during the Summer of 2020 while in Fort
          Lauderdale, Florida, during the Covid-19 epidemic. I felt a strong connection immediately upon picking the
          pages up, and decided a proper digital replication of the work should be made to recognize the efforts that
          went into making the world a better place.</p>

        <p>This work's introduction ended with:</p>

        <p>"If we had had more descriptions of the horrors of war maybe we would have fewer of them."</p>

        <p>I hope the duplication of this text can help us refelct on what is at stake when we ignore empathy with the
          world around us, and that we may find that more peaceful world offered in his words.</p>
